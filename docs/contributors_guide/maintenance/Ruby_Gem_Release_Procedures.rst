Ruby Gem Release Procedures
===========================

This section will decribe the release procedures for the SIMP Ruby gems
used to build and test SIMP components. The relevant components include

* ``rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers``
* ``rubygem-simp-rake-helpers``
* ``rubygem-simp-rspec-puppet-facts``

For demonstration purposes, we will be using the ``simp-rake-helpers``
project, which uses the ``master`` branch as its development branch.
